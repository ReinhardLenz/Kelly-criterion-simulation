 Kelly-criterion-simulation
a web page written in php, which allows user to set start criteria and then let the web page run and show, to what it leads. I always regretted, that in my school time, I wasn't really taught anything about economics, and we didn't talk too much about it in the family, money was a taboo somehow. Instead, knowledge of classic latin was valued. But it seems, that Understanding Kelly critering is quite a valuable skill.

The input is Win $probability, Odds of the event $odds, start capital $start_cap and fraction of bankroll to be wagered $fraction_wagered.

The program generates the array variables for each stage of the game  $winloose=range(1,20,1) etc.

The radom win or loose is generated by the random event$winloose[$n]=rand(0,100) and then it is decided, whether it is loose or win, by the if statement if($winloose[$n]<$probability)

In the following, the capital of each stage of the game is calculated.

At last, the 2D column chart is created


 
 where the height of the columns is calculated  depending on array variable$capital[$n]
  $height[$n]=strval(round(300*$capital[$n]/$max_height_corresponds,PHP_ROUND_HALF_DOWN));
